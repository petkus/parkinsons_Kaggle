# Parkinson's Freezing of Gait Prediction

This repo is code for the [Parkinson's Freezing of Gait Prediction Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tlvmc-parkinsons-freezing-gait-prediction/).


## Description of Files/Folders

- `models` stores trained pytorch models that might be useful
- `EDA.ipybnb` interactive session exploring the data
- `EDA.py` code that is useful for visualizing the data
- `config.yml` config file for running on local machine (might need to change
  to run locally)
- `nn_models.py` pytorch datapipeline and pytorch neural network model code
- `nn_models.ipynb` interactive session to debug/experiment with pytorch code
